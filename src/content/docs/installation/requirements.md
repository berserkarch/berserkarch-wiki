The installation requirements for **Berserk Arch** will vary depending on what you would like to install and your setup. For system requirements:

- On the low end, you can set up Berserk Arch as a basic Secure Shell (SSH) server with no desktop, using as little as
    - `128` MB of RAM (512 MB recommended) and
    - `2` GB of disk space.

    <br/>
    
- On the higher end, if you opt to install the default Xfce4 desktop, you should really aim for at least
    - `2` GB of RAM and 
    - `20` GB of disk space.
    - When using resource-intensive applications, such as Burp Suite, they recommend at least 8 GB of RAM (and even more if it is a large web application!) or using simultaneous programs at the same time.
